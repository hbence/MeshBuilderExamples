Mesh Builder Examples
--------

Example repository for [MeshBuilder](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilder/). The MeshBuilder submodule needs to be updated before opening the Unity project. It has the same requirements as MeshBuilder (Unity [2019.1.8f1 - 2020.1.17f], Burst [1.0.4 - 1.4.3], Mathematics [1.01 - 1.2.1], Collections [0.0.9 - 0.14.0-preview.16]).

Scenes
=========

1. **3D Template Pieces**

    ![3D Template Pieces](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/01.jpg)

    A simple scene rendering a volume with the template mesh pieces.

2. **Simple Chunk**

    ![Simple Chunk](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/02.jpg)

    A chunk rendering a volume with three different tiles. The ground is a combination of a heightmapped grid and tiles, the water is generated as a grid, the rocks are made from tiles. The tiles are rendered with simple MeshRenderers on separate game objects.

3. **Chunk From Code**

    ![Chunk From Code](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/03.jpg)

    The same scene as the previous, except everything is built and rendered from code (with Graphics.DrawMesh), there are no separate game objects.

4. **Adjacent Chunks**

    ![Adjacent Chunks](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/04.jpg)

    Adjacent chunks are aware of each other so the are built correctly. The chunks use separate game objects.

5. **Grid Generation / Frustum Culling**

    ![Frustum Culling](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/05.jpg)

    A bigger grid of adjacent chunks. Chunks are turned off outside the camera frustum.

6. **Lattice Deformation**

    ![Lattice Deformation](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/06.jpg)

    A generated mesh is deformed by a lattice.

7. **Terrain Lattice**

    ![Terrain Lattice](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/07.jpg)

    A lattice deformation applied to a chunk. There is a slider to see the effect of the deformation.

8. **Merge Test**

    ![Merge Test](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/08.jpg)

    Some game objects are randomly placed / enabled. Then merged into a single mesh.

9. **Nine Scale Mesh Drawer**

    ![Nine Scale Mesh Drawer](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/09.jpg)

    Two examples for the nine scaler, they can be resized with sliders. Instanced rendering can be switch on.

10. **Nine Scale Mesh Building**

    ![Nine Scale Mesh Building](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/10.jpg)

    A nine scaler fills out the target box with a merged mesh.

11. **2D Templates**

    ![2D Templates](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/11.jpg)

    A simple scene rendering the 2d piece templates.

12. **Dungeon Scene**

    ![Dungeon Scene](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/12.jpg)

    A simple scene with multiple tiles using the 2d tile meshers.

13. **Sample Editor**

    ![Sample Editor](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/13.jpg)

    A barebones editor using 2D Tile Meshers, Grid Meshers, a randomized Lattice Modifier for the tiles, MeshCombinationBuilder to merge the placed objects.

14. **Marching Squares Test**

    ![Marching Squares Test](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/14.jpg)

    Some brushes moving around on a distance field, drawn by the MarchingSquaresMesher.

15. **Marching Squares Drawing**

    ![Marching Squares Drawing](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/15.jpg)

    You can draw and erase with the mouse on the distance field. There are two MarchingSquaresMeshers with different settings, one has a lower resolution distance field and a tapered cell mesher.

16. **Marching Squares Optimized**

    ![Marching Squares Optimized](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/16.jpg)

    The Mode button switches between the triangulation modes. In optimized mode the center cells are merged and drawn as a single rectangle covering multiple cells.

17. **Marching Squares with Height data**

    ![Marching Squares with Height data](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/17.jpg)

    The marching squares distance data also contains height data. Changeing the brush mode to Increase / Decrease Height, the height can be manipulated.

18. **Marching Squares Culling**

    ![Marching Squares with Height data](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/18.jpg)

    Separate meshers can be used  as chunks and turned on/off as needed. Culling data can be set to skip areas in the mesh generation. (For example to avoid overdraw and wasted work if parts of the mesh are always covered.)

19. **Marching Squares Segmented Mesher**

    ![Marching Squares with Height data](https://github.com/hbence/MeshBuilderExamples/blob/readme/img/19.jpg)

    Showing off the segmented side mesher to generate more elaborate meshes.
